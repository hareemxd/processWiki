**Procedure**  
Set Up Permissions for Data Repositories
-------------------------------------------------

## **Applicable Domains:** Engineering, Configuration Management, Information Technology

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the process for establishing and maintaining permission schemes governing access to controlled engineering data stored in data repositories. Adherence to this process ensures data integrity across projects, repositories, and domains.

### 4. Scope

This process applies to DRS employees tasked with preserving the integrity of engineering data within a project team/organization, including Project Engineers, Lead Engineers, Engineering Managers, Technical Directors, as well as Configuration Management (CM) which performs validation/verification, implementation, and maintenance of the permissions scheme.

### 5. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                            | Responsibility                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            |
| Engineering Lead                | Defines access rules and roles based on project/data requirements; supports maintenance                                |
| Configuration Management        | Validates and implements permissions scheme in the repository; performs maintenance|
| IT/System Admin | Supports permission changes requiring system-level privileges                                    |

---

### 6. Permission Guidelines

Permission schemes are based on the RACI framework:

| Access Level    | Role Definition        | Responsibilities                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Responsible (R) | Modify/edit data    | Modify data; write commit messages      |
| Accountable (A) | Approve changes        | Participate in Peer Review |
| Consulted (C)   | Provide feedback| Participate in Peer Review                 |
| Informed (I)    | Read-only access       | View finalized or released data    |

The Engineering Lead is responsible for defining these roles per artifact/artifact type or project. For efforts of sufficient complexity, multiple Engineering Leads may be tasked with defining the access rules and roles for a project (e.g. Mechanical, Electrical, Systems Leads).  

The permissions scheme should be tailored to the specific constraints of a project and consider the following factors:
* Project type (development, production)
* Project complexity
* Project CM requirements

The permissions scheme shall be documented in a project Configuration Management Plan.

### 7. Process

#### 7.1 Define Access Requirements
The process triggers when DRS identifies a need to establish CM control in data repositories.
1. Engineering Lead researches the target data repository, CM requirements, stakeholders, and stakeholder needs.
2. Engineering Lead defines access needs per user group within a RACI framework and in accordance with CM-003 Preserve Data Integrity.

#### 7.2 Submit Permission Scheme Request

4. Engineering Lead completes the **Permission Specification Template**, including:

   * Target data repository
   * Project CM requirements
   * User groups ( each associated with RACI access level)
   * Description of each role assignment

5. Engineering Lead submits the completed request to CM.

#### 7.3 Implement Permissions

6. CM confirms the requested Permissions Scheme is valid and compliant with the stated requirements.
7. CM enables permissions for two (2) users per user group in the repository and uploads a set of dummy files that validate the implementation.

#### 7.4 Validate and Finalize Implementation

8. Engineering Lead reviews permission settings for correctness.
9. CM validates the implementation by collecting feedback from the enabled users.
10. CM resolves any discrepancies/issues.
11. CM finalizes the implementation by enabling permissions for the remaining users.

#### 7.5 Maintain Permissions
11. Engineering Lead coordinates with CM to give permissions to new team members and remove permissions from former team members.
12. CM performs routine audits to ensure the integrity of the permission scheme is maintained and that users are assigned to and using their permissions appropriately.

### 8. Compliance

* All DRS employees tasked with preserving the integrity of engineering data shall comply with this process.
